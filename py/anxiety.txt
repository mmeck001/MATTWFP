Treatment[edit]
Treatment options available include lifestyle changes, therapy, and medications. Medication are only recommended if other measures are not effective.[7] Stopping smoking has benefits in anxiety as large as or larger than those of medications.[71] Reducing caffeine intake and regular exercise are also useful measures.

Therapy[edit]
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for anxiety disorders.[72][73][74] CBT appears to be equally effective when carried out via the internet.[75] While evidence for mental health apps is promising it is preliminary.[76]

In social phobia a specific form of short-term CBT, the central component being gradual exposure therapy. Self-help books can contribute to the treatment of people with anxiety disorders.[77]

Mindfulness based programs also appear to be effective for managing anxiety disorders.[78][79] It is unclear if meditation has an effect on anxiety and transcendental meditation appears to be no different than other types of meditation.[80]

Medications[edit]
Treatment controversy arises because while some studies indicate that a combination of medication and psychotherapy can be more effective than either one alone, others suggest medications have little added benefit for some patients, are largely palliative, and/or can actually interfere with the mechanisms of successful therapy (e.g., benzodiazepines).[81][82] Psychotherapeutic interventions have better long-term efficacy compared to pharmacotherapy.[83]

Antidepressants[edit]
Due to shared biological characteristics between depression and anxiety, antidepressants are the first-line medication treatment for anxiety disorders. While psychotherapy is generally the preferred treatment for anxiety due to efficacy and low side effect risks, medications are often used to augment psychotherapy or when an individual declines other treatments (e.g., due to avoidance of talking about anxiety-provoking material).[7] If medications are to be used, SSRIs are recommended as first-line agents. MAOIs such as phenelzine and tranylcypromine are considered an effective treatment and are especially useful in treatment-resistant cases, however, dietary restrictions and medical interactions may limit their use.[84][85]

In children and adolescents, when a medication option is warranted, antidepressants such as SSRIs, SNRIs as well as tricyclic antidepressants can be effective. The effectiveness and increased suicide risk of SSRIs among children and adolescents has been subject to controversy. General side effects are common and may include headaches, nausea, insomnia, and changes in sexual behavior. Treatment safety during pregnancy has not been established.[86] In late 2004 much media attention was given to a possible link between SSRI use and suicide. In 2005, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a comprehensive review based on 372 placebo-controlled trials involving almost 100,000 patients and issued a warning to general public regarding the correlation between the use of SSRIs and increased risk of suicide in younger adults.[87][88] In 2006, FDA's Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee concluded that labelling changes were required to inform health care professionals and general public about the potential risks of suicide.[89]

These medications need to be used with care among older adults, who are more likely to have side effects because of coexisting physical disorders. Adherence problems are more likely among elderly patients, who may have difficulty understanding, seeing, or remembering instructions.[11]

Other drugs[edit]
Some people with a form of social phobia called performance phobia have been helped by beta-blockers. Taken in low doses, they control the physical manifestation of anxiety and can be taken before a public performance.[medical citation needed]

The atypical antipsychotic quetiapine appears effective in generalized anxiety disorder; however, rates of adverse effects are greater than that with SSRIs.[90] Evidence for risperidone and olanzapine is not enough to make any comments.[90]

Pregabalin, an anticonvulsant with anxiolytic properties, may be effective.[91]

Benzodiazepines are often used adjunctively with SSRIs, for short-term or "as needed" relief of severe, disabling anxiety.[92] While anxiolytic and hypnotic effects usually begin to appear within minutes or hours, benzodiazepines can also cause or worsen anxiety in therapeutic dosage, intoxication, rebound between doses, withdrawal, and from chronic use. Additionally, while benzodiazepines may be helpful in the short-term for some with panic disorder, panic attacks in panic disorder appear to be different biologically than panic attacks in other anxiety disorders, for which benzodiazepines often have no effect or actually worsen symptoms.[82] Like alcohol, benzodiazepines can put people to sleep but, while asleep, they disrupt sleep architecture (i.e., benzodiazepine-induced sleep disorder): decreasing sleep time, delaying time to REM sleep, and decreasing deep sleep (the most restorative part of sleep for both energy and mood).[93][94][95] Therefore, benzodiazepines can indirectly worsen anxiety by worsening sleep. They are usually considered second-line or lower anxiety treatments due to disadvantages such as tolerance, cognitive impairment (which can actually inhibit the benefits of psychotherapy), risks of dependence and recreational abuse.[82][96] It has been recommended that benzodiazepines only be considered for individuals who fail to respond to safer, more effective medications.[82][97] Benzodiazepines are not, however, effective or safe in the treatment of children and adolescents who have an anxiety disorder.[98]

Caffeine[edit]
Caffeine can cause anxiety, along with more minor effects such as muscle twitching, hand tremors, and headaches. The best way to prevent caffeinism is to either wean off caffeine completely or reduce consumption.[99] For some people, anxiety can be reduced by coming off caffeine.[100] Anxiety can temporarily increase during caffeine withdrawal.[101][102][103]

Alternative medicine[edit]
Regular exercise[104] and reducing caffeine[105] are often useful in treating anxiety. A 2006 review found a small but tentative benefit of exercise for anxiety in children.[106] There is tentative evidence that yoga may be effective.[107] In 2006 a Cochrane review found evidence was insufficient regarding meditation to make any conclusions.[108] A 2010 review concluded the evidence was promising.[109]

Many other remedies have been used for anxiety disorder. These include kava, where the potential for benefit seems greater than that for harm with short-term use in those with mild to moderate anxiety.[110][111] The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends use of kava for those with mild to moderate anxiety disorders who are not using alcohol or taking other medicines metabolized by the liver, but who wish to use "natural" remedies.[112] Side effects of kava in the clinical trials were rare and mild.

Inositol has been found to have modest effects in people with panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder.[113] There is insufficient evidence to support the use of St. John's wort, valerian or passionflower.[113]

Aromatherapy has shown some tentative benefits for anxiety reduction in people with cancer when done with massages, although it not clear whether it could just enhance the effect of massage itself.[114]

Children[edit]
Several methods of treatment have been found to be effective in treating childhood anxiety disorders. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a well-established treatment for anxiety related disorders in children and adolescents, is a good first therapy approach.[115] Studies have also gathered substantial evidence for treatments that are not CBT based as being effective forms of treament, expanding treatment options for those who do not respond to CBT.[115] Like adults, children may undergo psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or counseling.

They may be given medication such as SSRIs. Buspar is not effective in children and adolescents who have an anxiety disorder.[98] However, administering medications like antidepressants to children is controversial. As a result, other forms of treatment have become increasingly popular. Family therapy is a form of treatment in which the child meets with a therapist together with the primary guardians and siblings. Each family member may attend individual therapy, but family therapy is typically a form of group therapy. Art and play therapy are also used. Art therapy is most commonly used when the child will not or cannot verbally communicate, due to trauma or a disability in which they are nonverbal. Participating in art activities allows the child to express what they otherwise may not be able to communicate to others.[116] In play therapy, the child is allowed to play however they please as a therapist observes them. The therapist may intercede from time to time with a question, comment, or suggestion. This is often most effective when the family of the child plays a significant role in the treatment.[117]
