Prevention
Preventative efforts may result in decreases in rates of the condition of between 22 and 38%.[155] Eating large amounts of fish may also reduce the risk.[156]

Behavioral interventions, such as interpersonal therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy, are effective at preventing new onset depression.[155][157][158] Because such interventions appear to be most effective when delivered to individuals or small groups, it has been suggested that they may be able to reach their large target audience most efficiently through the Internet.[159]

However, an earlier meta-analysis found preventive programs with a competence-enhancing component to be superior to behavior-oriented programs overall, and found behavioral programs to be particularly unhelpful for older people, for whom social support programs were uniquely beneficial. In addition, the programs that best prevented depression comprised more than eight sessions, each lasting between 60 and 90 minutes, were provided by a combination of lay and professional workers, had a high-quality research design, reported attrition rates, and had a well-defined intervention.[160]

The Netherlands mental health care system provides preventive interventions, such as the "Coping with Depression" course (CWD) for people with sub-threshold depression. The course is claimed to be the most successful of psychoeducational interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression (both for its adaptability to various populations and its results), with a risk reduction of 38% in major depression and an efficacy as a treatment comparing favorably to other psychotherapies.[157][161]

Management
Main article: Management of depression
The three most common treatments for depression are psychotherapy, medication, and electroconvulsive therapy. Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice (over medication) for people under 18. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2004 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be used for the initial treatment of mild depression, because the risk-benefit ratio is poor. The guidelines recommend that antidepressants treatment in combination with psychosocial interventions should be considered for:

People with a history of moderate or severe depression
Those with mild depression that has been present for a long period
As a second line treatment for mild depression that persists after other interventions
As a first line treatment for moderate or severe depression.
The guidelines further note that antidepressant treatment should be continued for at least six months to reduce the risk of relapse, and that SSRIs are better tolerated than tricyclic antidepressants.[162]

American Psychiatric Association treatment guidelines recommend that initial treatment should be individually tailored based on factors including severity of symptoms, co-existing disorders, prior treatment experience, and patient preference. Options may include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or light therapy. Antidepressant medication is recommended as an initial treatment choice in people with mild, moderate, or severe major depression, and should be given to all patients with severe depression unless ECT is planned.[163]

Treatment options are much more limited in developing countries, where access to mental health staff, medication, and psychotherapy is often difficult. Development of mental health services is minimal in many countries; depression is viewed as a phenomenon of the developed world despite evidence to the contrary, and not as an inherently life-threatening condition.[164] A 2014 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of psychological versus medical therapy in children.[165]

Psychotherapy
Psychotherapy can be delivered, to individuals, groups, or families by mental health professionals. A 2015 review found that cognitive behavioral therapy appears to be similar to antidepressant medication in terms of effect.[166] A 2012 review found psychotherapy to be better than no treatment but not other treatments.[167] With more complex and chronic forms of depression, a combination of medication and psychotherapy may be used.[168][169] A 2014 Cochrane review found that work-directed interventions combined with clinical interventions helped to reduce sick days taken by people with depression.[170]

Psychotherapy has been shown to be effective in older people.[171][172] Successful psychotherapy appears to reduce the recurrence of depression even after it has been terminated or replaced by occasional booster sessions.

Cognitive behavioral therapy
See also: Behavioral theories of depression
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) currently has the most research evidence for the treatment of depression in children and adolescents, and CBT and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are preferred therapies for adolescent depression.[173] In people under 18, according to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, medication should be offered only in conjunction with a psychological therapy, such as CBT, interpersonal therapy, or family therapy.[174] Cognitive behavioral therapy has also been shown to reduce the number of sick days taken by people with depression, when used in conjunction with primary care.[170]

The most-studied form of psychotherapy for depression is CBT, which teaches clients to challenge self-defeating, but enduring ways of thinking (cognitions) and change counter-productive behaviors. Research beginning in the mid-1990s suggested that CBT could perform as well or as better than antidepressants in patients with moderate to severe depression.[175][176] CBT may be effective in depressed adolescents,[177] although its effects on severe episodes are not definitively known.[178] Several variables predict success for cognitive behavioral therapy in adolescents: higher levels of rational thoughts, less hopelessness, fewer negative thoughts, and fewer cognitive distortions.[179] CBT is particularly beneficial in preventing relapse.[180][181]

Variants
Several variants of cognitive behavior therapy have been used in those with depression, the most notable being rational emotive behavior therapy,[182] and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.[183] Mindfulness based stress reduction programs may reduce depression symptoms.[184][185] Mindfulness programs also appear to be a promising intervention in youth.[186]

Psychoanalysis
Psychoanalysis is a school of thought, founded by Sigmund Freud, which emphasizes the resolution of unconscious mental conflicts.[187] Psychoanalytic techniques are used by some practitioners to treat clients presenting with major depression.[188] A more widely practiced, eclectic technique, called psychodynamic psychotherapy, is loosely based on psychoanalysis and has an additional social and interpersonal focus.[189] In a meta-analysis of three controlled trials of Short Psychodynamic Supportive Psychotherapy, this modification was found to be as effective as medication for mild to moderate depression.[190]

Antidepressants

Zoloft (sertraline) is used primarily to treat major depression in adult outpatients. In 2007, it was the most prescribed antidepressant on the U.S. retail market, with 29,652,000 prescriptions.[191]
Conflicting results have arisen from studies that look at the effectiveness of antidepressants in people with acute, mild to moderate depression. Stronger evidence supports the usefulness of antidepressants in the treatment of depression that is chronic (dysthymia) or severe.

While small benefits were found, researchers Irving Kirsch and Thomas Moore state they may be due to issues with the trials rather than a true effect of the medication.[192] In a later publication, Kirsch concluded that the overall effect of new-generation antidepressant medication is below recommended criteria for clinical significance.[6] Similar results were obtained in a meta analysis by Fornier.[5]

A review commissioned by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence concluded that there is strong evidence that SSRIs have greater efficacy than placebo on achieving a 50% reduction in depression scores in moderate and severe major depression, and that there is some evidence for a similar effect in mild depression.[193] Similarly, a Cochrane systematic review of clinical trials of the generic antidepressant amitriptyline concluded that there is strong evidence that its efficacy is superior to placebo.[194]

In 2014 the U.S. FDA published a systematic review of all antidepressant maintenance trials submitted to the agency between 1985 and 2012. The authors concluded that maintenance treatment reduced the risk of relapse by 52% compared to placebo, and that this effect was primarily due to recurrent depression in the placebo group rather than a drug withdrawal effect.[5]

To find the most effective antidepressant medication with minimal side-effects, the dosages can be adjusted, and if necessary, combinations of different classes of antidepressants can be tried. Response rates to the first antidepressant administered range from 50â€“75%, and it can take at least six to eight weeks from the start of medication to remission.[195] Antidepressant medication treatment is usually continued for 16 to 20 weeks after remission, to minimize the chance of recurrence,[195] and even up to one year of continuation is recommended.[196] People with chronic depression may need to take medication indefinitely to avoid relapse.[7]

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the primary medications prescribed, owing to their relatively mild side-effects, and because they are less toxic in overdose than other antidepressants.[197] People who do not respond to one SSRI can be switched to another antidepressant, and this results in improvement in almost 50% of cases.[198] Another option is to switch to the atypical antidepressant bupropion.[199] Venlafaxine, an antidepressant with a different mechanism of action, may be modestly more effective than SSRIs.[200] However, venlafaxine is not recommended in the UK as a first-line treatment because of evidence suggesting its risks may outweigh benefits,[201] and it is specifically discouraged in children and adolescents.[202][203]

For adolescent depression, fluoxetine is recommended.[202] Fluoxetine appear to have only slight benefit in children,[204] while other antidepressants have not been shown to be exffective.[205] There is also insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness in those with depression complicated by dementia.[206] Any antidepressant can cause low serum sodium levels (also called hyponatremia);[207] nevertheless, it has been reported more often with SSRIs.[197] It is not uncommon for SSRIs to cause or worsen insomnia; the sedating antidepressant mirtazapine can be used in such cases.[208][209]

Irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors, an older class of antidepressants, have been plagued by potentially life-threatening dietary and drug interactions. They are still used only rarely, although newer and better-tolerated agents of this class have been developed.[210] The safety profile is different with reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as moclobemide where the risk of serious dietary interactions is negligible and dietary restrictions are less strict.[211]

For children, adolescents, and probably young adults between 18 and 24 years old, there is a higher risk of both suicidal ideations and suicidal behavior in those treated with SSRIs.[212][213] For adults, it is unclear whether SSRIs affect the risk of suicidality. One review found no connection;[214] another an increased risk;[215] and a third no risk in those 25â€“65 years old and a decrease risk in those more than 65.[216] A black box warning was introduced in the United States in 2007 on SSRI and other antidepressant medications due to increased risk of suicide in patients younger than 24 years old.[217] Similar precautionary notice revisions were implemented by the Japanese Ministry of Health.[218]

Other medications
There is some evidence that fish oil supplements containing high levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may be effective in major depression,[219] but other meta-analysis of the research conclude that positive effects may be due to publication bias.[220] There is some preliminary evidence that COX-2 inhibitors have a beneficial effect on major depression.[61] Lithium appears effective at lowering the risk of suicide in those with bipolar disorder and unipolar depression to nearly the same levels as the general population.[221] There is a narrow range of effective and safe dosages of lithium thus close monitoring may be needed.[222] Low-dose thyroid hormone may be added to existing antidepressants to treat persistent depression symptoms in people who have tried multiple courses of medication.[223]

Electroconvulsive therapy
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a standard psychiatric treatment in which seizures are electrically induced in patients to provide relief from psychiatric illnesses.[224]:1880 ECT is used with informed consent[225] as a last line of intervention for major depressive disorder.[226]

A round of ECT is effective for about 50% of people with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, whether it is unipolar or bipolar.[227] Follow-up treatment is still poorly studied, but about half of people who respond, relapse with twelve months.[228]

Aside from effects in the brain, the general physical risks of ECT are similar to those of brief general anesthesia.[229]:259 Immediately following treatment, the most common adverse effects are confusion and memory loss.[226][230] ECT is considered one of the least harmful treatment options available for severely depressed pregnant women.[231]

A usual course of ECT involves multiple administrations, typically given two or three times per week until the patient is no longer suffering symptoms ECT is administered under anesthetic with a muscle relaxant.[232] Electroconvulsive therapy can differ in its application in three ways: electrode placement, frequency of treatments, and the electrical waveform of the stimulus. These three forms of application have significant differences in both adverse side effects and symptom remission. After treatment, drug therapy is usually continued, and some patients receive maintenance ECT.[226]

ECT appears to work in the short term via an anticonvulsant effect mostly in the frontal lobes, and longer term via neurotrophic effects primarily in the medial temporal lobe.[233]

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or deep transcranial magnetic stimulation is a noninvasive method used to stimulate small regions of the brain.[234] TMS was approved by the FDA for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder in 2008[235] and as of 2014 evidence supports this use.[236] The American Psychiatric Association[237] the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Disorders,[238] and the Royal Australia and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists have endorsed rTMS for trMDD.[239]

Other
Further information: Neurobiological effects of physical exercise Â§ Major depressive disorder
Bright light therapy reduces depression symptom severity, with benefit was found for both seasonal affective disorder and for nonseasonal depression, and an effect similar to those for conventional antidepressants. For non-seasonal depression, adding light therapy to the standard antidepressant treatment was not effective.[240] For non-seasonal depression where light was used mostly in combination with antidepressants or wake therapy a moderate effect was found, with response better than control treatment in high-quality studies, in studies that applied morning light treatment, and with people who respond to total or partial sleep deprivation.[241] Both analyses noted poor quality, short duration, and small size of most of the reviewed studies.

There is a small amount of evidence that skipping a night's sleep may help.[242] Physical exercise is recommended for management of mild depression,[243] and has a moderate effect on symptoms.[244] It is equivalent to the use of medications or psychological therapies in most people.[244] In the older people it does appear to decrease depression.[245] In unblinded, non-randomized observational studies smoking cessation has benefits in depression as large as or larger than those of medications.[246] Cognitive behavioral therapy and occupational programs (including modification of work activities and assistance) have been shown to be effective in reducing sick days taken by workers with depression.[247]
